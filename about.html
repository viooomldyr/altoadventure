        >Alto's Adventure is a 2015 endless runner snowboarding video game
        developed by Team Alto and published by Snowman (iOS) and Noodlecake
        Studios (Android). The player-character automatically moves to the right
        of the screen through procedurally generated landscapes. The player taps
        the screen to jump and perform tricks (backflips), and works towards
        goals, competitive high scores, and upgrades. <br /><br />According to
        review score aggregator Metacritic, the game received universal acclaim
        from critics. Reviewers praised its art style and sense of atmosphere
        but criticized its gameplay as unoriginal. Pocket Gamer awarded the game
        their Gold Award. A sequel, Alto's Odyssey, was released in 2018.</span
